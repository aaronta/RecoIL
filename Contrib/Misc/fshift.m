function y = fshift(x,s)
% FSHIFT Fractional circular shift
%   Syntax:
%
%       >> y = fshift(x,s)
%
%   FSHIFT circularly shifts the elements of vector x by a (possibly
%   non-integer) number of elements s. FSHIFT works by applying a linear
%   phase in the spectrum domain and is equivalent to CIRCSHIFT for integer
%   values of argument s (to machine precision).

    % For even signals, f(1) = -1 and phase is sampled at -pi. 
    % The correct value for p(1) should be the average of the f = -1 and

    % symmetric) magnitude, the average is the real part of p.
